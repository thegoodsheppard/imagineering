So, this is the first post, and I feel a bit lost. I am putting this site together with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) in order to figure out how to do it and so the point is that I don't know what I am doing and am willing to suck in order to invest in my future self. I have put enough time into 11ty at this point that I am starting to get more comfortable with how it works, but the problem is that I don't know basic web design.
