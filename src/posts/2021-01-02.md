Well, I was interrupted last night while writing the first post but I am going to leave it as-is. I would adjust that last sentence to say not that I don't know basic web design because I have been spending a lot of time learning it, but that I now need to spend more time applying the concepts in order to solidify them into actionable skills.

Anyhow, the first thing that I need to do for this project is get the site deployed. Once I have that I'll put a basic layout in place and iterate from there.
